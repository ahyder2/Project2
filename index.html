         Hello, My name is Asim Hyder. This home page is here to tell you a little bit about me and also help you navigate throughout the webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
         I am currently 21 years old and will turn 22 in March. I was born in Toronto Canada and lived there for about 2 years before my family moved here to Chicago. I still visit Canada often and have a lot of friends there. I lived in Chicago until I was in 2nd Grade where I moved to Plainfield, IL. I lived there for most of my life, finishing high school there at Plainfield South in 2016. From 2016-2018 I attended University iof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an Undecided Engineer but was consdiering Computer Engineering. Ultimately, I decided engineering wasn't for me and so I transferred here to do ITM and at the same time my family moved to Skokie.

         As I mentioned on my home page, I am deeply interested and greatly involved in esports. I watch quite a few of them but the 2 I watch the the most are Overwatch and CS:GO. I am also a board member of ITE (Illinois Tech Esports), where I serve as a coach for both the A and B team for Overwatch and am the Player Manager for the organization.

         I coach both the A and B team for our school's Overwatch team along side one other person. Last year our A team was very close to making playoffs but we missed it by just 4 places. To get to playoffs we had to be top 64 in the nation (out of hundreds of teams) and we got 68th. We play in a collegiate league called Tespa, and while Tespa is in off season, we participate in the Path to Pro Open Division. Check out the tournament <a href="https://compete.tespa.org/tournament/145">here</a>!

         What is OWL?
      </h3>
      <p>
         Overwatch League is the official Esports organization for Overwatch. It involves 20 teams based off cities much like traditional sports teams. The teams are spread out all around the world in countries such as the US, Canada, China, Korea, the UK, and France. The teams are owned by massive esports organizations such as Envyus, big corporations such as Comcast, and owners of traditional sports teams such as the New England Patriots and the NY Mets.

      <h3>
         Favorite Teams and Players.
      </h3>
      <p>
         My 2 favorite teams are the Toronto Defiant and New York Excelsior. The Toronto Defiant have had a pretty terrible season but since they represent my birth town, I root for them.They also have some of my favorite players such as Gods, Mangachu, and Neko. New York has had a great season and are one of the top teams and it includes some of my favorite players, especially in the role that I prefer to play which is support. Chicago is expected to get a team in 2021 so I'll be rooting for them when that comes. Check out this video of my favorite support player, JJonak, winning MVP in 2018.
